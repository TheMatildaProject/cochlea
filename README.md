# Cochlea

The cochlea /ˈkɒk.liə/ (Ancient Greek: κοχλίας, kōhlias, meaning spiral or snail shell) is the auditory portion of the inner ear. Matilda's cochlea is a Python app that is constantly listening to the environment looking for commands.


## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py [<url to auditory-cortex>](https://github.com/TheMatildaProject/auditory-cortex)
```

So far I haven't been able to bind the host's microphone to the docker container, therefore can't offer this as a Docker image, if anyone has any clues on how to do this, I'd be most grateful if you sent a PR.
